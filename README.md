# SISTER (Smallsat Innovative Satellite Technology Enabling Research) 
A dual-use synchronized phased array utilizing a software-defined radio to test inter-formation networking and precise navigation and timing is being built. This device will later use 24-GHz Ka-band to allow data-rates of 1-Gbps. The prototype will be presented in March 2020 at the conclusion of the effort. The payload functions as a passive radar and directed beam by utilizing electronic beam-forming, passive illumination, and network time reference protocols. During AY 2020-2021, 2 demonstration CubeSats will be built to test this game-changing technology in formation flying. 

## Orbit Determination/Signal Processing
Assuming a network with a TDMA-architecture or beacon transmitting at some known interval; the range will be calculated based on the received signal. Additionally a radar return will be added to the information used to calculate the state of the satellites within the formation.
